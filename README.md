### Introduction
We have all tried to follow a diet. In fact if you quickly look online you'll find hundreds of miracle solutions and none of them actually work. We are looking for the best possible diet but, for us, it's right in front of our eyes: The Mediterranean Diet.

Although the mediterranean diet is well known, there is still a lot of confusion regarding what is it really composed of and it is not easy to find clear steps to follow it.

On the other hand, although it is not a miracle diet, the results have been medicaly proven numerous times and having professional assistance to follow its eating principles always is a good help.

Vimet (https://casavimet.com/) brings the Mediterranean Diet to your kitchen assessed by the most relevant medical doctors and nutricionists in the field. Vimet plans your weekly diet for you, so that you only have to buy the groceries and prepare the delicious yet healthy meals. It also comes with the weekly plan so you can plan ahead and follow the guidelines.

### Overview
Vimet has been up and running for almost a year now and after around 200 orders and 50 clients, they would like to answer some questions with the data collected during this time.

* Is there any product that maximises sales?
Statistical approach: H0: Mean sales higher for a specific product compared to the rest of products (Method: depends on distr. t-Student?)
* Are there any specific user profiles?
Statistical approach: Classifier with ML (Method: MiniBatch K-Means)
* Is there any item combination that maximises profit?
Statistical approach: H0: Mean profit higher for a specific product compared to the rest of products (Method: depends on distr. t-Student?)

All of these questions can be answered with the available data. The main potential issue will be the low amount of data as we only have around 200 orders and 50 clients.

Success will be defined if any of the 3 questions have a statistically significant answer and/or a decision-making tool can be defined (e.g. descriptive data on best combinations of products)

### Data Preparation
We will work with 2 datasets:
* Oders register:
(General description of the dataset such as the size, complexity, data types, etc.)
* Items Register: 
(General description of the dataset such as the size, complexity, data types, etc.)

Both Datasets were provided by Vimet

### Data Ingestion & Database
During the ETL process we will transform the data so it can be properly saved in an SQL database. The tables' structure is the following.

The customers table is not uploaded as it was not provided by Vimet to comply with GDPR as the data contains personal information of the customers. However it is included in the schema as it can be implemented in next steps.
The DataBase is hosted by Google Cloud.

### Data Wrangling and Cleaning
We start with the ETL process. The data is obtained via a csv provided by Vimet that includes all the information from the Shopify server. This process could be automatized in future steps. Once the data is obtained, we run a first script to transform and load the data to our SQL database.This transformation includes dividing the whole database into the corresponding tables.
After this, each of the tables are transformed to enable analysing the data. From this step on, we will have data we can work with.

Three main steps will follow in paralel:
* Descriptive study of the data.
* Hypothesis testing
* Creation of a ML model.

**Data Flow**
![Alter text](https://github.com/adriaferrer/Vimet/blob/master/DataFlow.png)

1) **Descriptive statistics**: In order to provide context for the analysis, a descriptive study will be performed on the data to identify the best-selling products, evolution of sales, etc.

2) **Hypothesis testing**: A statistical test will be performed to test the hypothesis set in the overview secion.

3) **ML model**: A clustering model will be trained and tested to cluster the type of customers.

### Data Analysis

#### Descriptive statistics
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Print charts to demonstrate the effect of your work. Charts make your presentation look good too.

#### Hypothesis testing
* Overview the general steps you will go through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.

#### ML model
* If you use ML in your final project, also describe your feature selection process.

### Model Training and Evaluation
* Train your ML model, produce results, and evaluate.
* This is an iterative process. Try your best to improve your model performance by:
  * Try different models and select one that is the simplest yet produce the best result.
  * Try advanced techniques and see if they improve the result.

### Conclusion
* Summarize your data analysis result.
* State your conclusion of your hypothesis testing.
* Interpret your findings in terms of the human-understandable question you try to answer.

### What are the next steps?
