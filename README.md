### Introduction
We have all tried to follow a diet. In fact if you quickly look online you'll find hundreds of miracle solutions and none of them actually work. We are looking for the best possible diet but, for us, it's right in front of our eyes: The Mediterranean Diet.

Although the mediterranean diet is well known, there is still a lot of confusion regarding what is it really composed of and it is not easy to find clear steps to follow it.

On the other hand, although it is not a miracle diet, the results have been medicaly proven numerous times and having professional assistance to follow its eating principles always is a good help.

Vimet (https://casavimet.com/) brings the Mediterranean Diet to your kitchen assessed by the most relevant medical doctors and nutricionists in the field. Vimet plans your weekly diet for you, so that you only have to buy the groceries and prepare the delicious yet healthy meals. It also comes with the weekly plan so you can plan ahead and follow the guidelines.

### Overview
Vimet has been up and running for almost a year now and after around 200 orders and 50 clients, they would like to answer some questions with the data collected during this time.

* Is there any product that maximises sales?
Statistical approach: H0: Mean sales higher for a specific product compared to the rest of products (Method: depends on distr. t-Student?)
* Are there any specific user profiles?
Statistical approach: Classifier with ML (Method: MiniBatch K-Means)
* Is there any item combination that maximises profit?
Statistical approach: H0: Mean profit higher for a specific product compared to the rest of products (Method: depends on distr. t-Student?)

All of these questions can be answered with the available data. The main potential issue will be the low amount of data as we only have around 200 orders and 50 clients.

Success will be defined if any of the 3 questions have a statistically significant answer and/or a decision-making tool can be defined (e.g. descriptive data on best combinations of products)

### Data Preparation
We will work with 2 datasets:
* Oders register:
(General description of the dataset such as the size, complexity, data types, etc.)
* Items Register: 
(General description of the dataset such as the size, complexity, data types, etc.)

Both Datasets were provided by Vimet

### Data Ingestion & Database
* If you downloaded a dataset (either public or private), describe where you downloaded it and include the command to load the dataset.
* If you obtain the data via API/web scraping, provide the scripts.
* Provide a schema of your tables.

### Data Wrangling and Cleaning
Your full process of data wrangling and cleaning.
* Document your workflow and thinking process.

### Data Analysis
* Overview the general steps you will go through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Print charts to demonstrate the effect of your work. Charts make your presentation look good too.
* If you use ML in your final project, also describe your feature selection process.

### Model Training and Evaluation
* Train your ML model, produce results, and evaluate.
* This is an iterative process. Try your best to improve your model performance by:
  * Try different models and select one that is the simplest yet produce the best result.
  * Try advanced techniques and see if they improve the result.

### Conclusion
* Summarize your data analysis result.
* State your conclusion of your hypothesis testing.
* Interpret your findings in terms of the human-understandable question you try to answer.

### What are the next steps?
